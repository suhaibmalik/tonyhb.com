I'm working on a new blog right now, and am slowly migrating my old posts to
this new format (hence the big gap between 2012 and 2013!). The new blog will
house development thoughts and tips, website teardowns, my portfolio and
updates for projects I'm working on.

I'm quite excited to see it take shape, and there's one post in particular I'm
looking forward to doing...

## Website Teardowns 

These are a new kind of post for me. We'll go through how sites are built and
the technologies they use to create some case studies to learn from. We'll start
small and gradually get bigger, moving from things like CSS3 transitions and
jQuery to BackboneJS, canvas and 3D rendering with Three.JS.
