There are some great articles out there that really break down knowledge and help you understand *how and why* things work. The frustrating part for me is when I'm in "get shit done" mode and want to learn something immediately: I don't want to spend 30 minutes wading through the text.

Wouldn't it be great to take that same article, have the key points and reasoning in a short summary, and have any examples/code snippets/graphics sitting alongside? I feel like we would be so much more productive at learning whilst doing. And it would make a great primer for the complete text when you’re in full-learning-mode.

With this in mind I might start a new blogging engine introducing "tldr mode". Eventually I’d love to have something automated to do this for posts.

The plan is:

- Soup up the open source blog engine (it’s very barebones)
- Set up a service for people to sign up and write their blog posts. 
- Automate summarising after a well-built corpus.
- Build an API to summarise other website’s content

This post isn’t the best example. Think of it being used for something like this: http://www.alexedwards.net/blog/a-recap-of-request-handling
